## Projects
Finished the [[nacre]] architecture document. All major design decisions are locked in. The ingestion pipeline has 7 stages: discover, parse, extract, resolve, update, decay, persist. Each stage is a pure function that transforms data — very testable.

Quick update on [[tide-pool]] — marcus pushed the final Phase 2 patches. The simulation is stable and performant. Moving to maintenance mode.

[[barnacle]] kickoff with **James** and **Alex**. It is a monitoring dashboard that will visualize agent health metrics. Planning to use [[Vite]] and **D3.js** for the charts.

## Research
Looked into **GSD workflow** patterns for managing the nacre build. The phase-based approach with research → plan → execute → verify fits perfectly. Phase 1 is core engine and parser, Phase 2 is visualization, Phase 3 is integration.

Also studied **spatial memory** concepts from cognitive science. The method of loci — associating information with physical locations — is exactly what nacre does digitally. Nodes exist in a 3D space where position encodes temporal distance. #research

## Tools
**Playwright** for testing the barnacle dashboard. Set up a test harness that spins up a dev server, navigates to the dashboard, and asserts on DOM elements. Very clean integration testing pattern.

## Events
**Nacre architecture complete** — the full technical specification is documented with data model, pipeline stages, decay math, visualization design, and phase plan. Ready to build.

## Decisions
Decided on **JSON file persistence** for Phase 1 rather than SQLite. Simpler, version-controllable, and sufficient for graphs under 10k nodes. Due to this choice, the persistence layer is trivial — just JSON.stringify and writeFile.
