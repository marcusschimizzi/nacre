## Projects
Deep into [[nacre]] research today. Read three Perplexity reports on 3D graph visualization, entity extraction, and knowledge graph patterns. Key finding: no existing PKM tool implements automatic link discovery with weighted edges and decay. This is a genuine gap.

[[honeycomber]] got a bug report from **Dr. Chen** — the event aggregation was double-counting in certain timezone edge cases. **Sarah** is investigating.

## Research
The **3d-force-graph** library looks perfect for nacre visualization. Built on **Three.js** and WebGL, handles 4k+ nodes smoothly. Supports custom forces which we need for the temporal z-axis — recent memories close, older ones receding into depth. The **force-directed graph** layout lets clusters form naturally.

**Entity resolution** is going to be tricky. "Marcus" and "Marcus S" and "marcus" all need to resolve to the same node. Plan: normalize text, check aliases, then fuzzy match with Levenshtein distance. This led to designing a multi-stage resolution pipeline. #research

## Tools
Tested **compromise.js** with sample text from my memory files. The `.people()` extraction is solid for names like "Marcus" and "Sarah" but struggles with technical terms that look like names. Need a hybrid approach: structural extraction (wikilinks, bold) plus NLP plus custom domain rules.

## Decisions
Chose a **hybrid extraction pipeline** — three extractors running in parallel: structural (regex for markdown syntax), NLP (compromise.js for people/places), and custom (domain-specific rules for tools and projects). Each extractor emits raw entities with confidence scores. Because of this approach, we can tune each extractor independently.

## Lessons
**No NLP library handles markdown-aware extraction** — you always need a markdown parser first, then run NLP on the extracted text. Trying to run NLP on raw markdown produces garbage results.
