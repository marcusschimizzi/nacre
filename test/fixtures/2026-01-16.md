## Projects
Wrapping up [[tide-pool]] Phase 2 this week. **Marcus** reviewed the final PR and suggested simplifying the particle spawn logic. Good instinct — the complex version had an edge case with boundary reflections that was causing particles to leak outside the container.

Started scoping [[nacre]] more seriously. Read the **Ebbinghaus curve** research on forgetting and retention. The idea of applying **memory consolidation** patterns to a knowledge graph is compelling. Memories that get reinforced persist; those that don't fade naturally.

Checked on [[reef]] — **Alex** is making progress on the agent orchestration layer. The spawn/kill lifecycle is clean.

## Tools
Heavy **TypeScript** day — type-level programming for the ECS component registry. Used conditional types and mapped types extensively. **Vite** plugin system came in handy for custom shader preprocessing.

## Research
Deep dive into **context engineering** — how to prime an AI agent with the right information at session startup. The current approach of reading flat markdown files is linear and misses connections. A graph-based approach like nacre could surface related context associatively. #research

## Decisions
**Picked compromise.js** over wink-nlp for entity extraction in nacre. Simpler API, smaller bundle, and good enough accuracy for our needs. The `.people()` and `.organizations()` methods are exactly what we want.

## Lessons
**Type-level programming has diminishing returns** — after a certain complexity threshold, the types themselves become bugs. Keep it simple where possible.
