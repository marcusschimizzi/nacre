## Projects
Started the day reviewing [[tide-pool]] architecture with **Marcus**. The simulation engine is coming together nicely — the `bitECS` entity component system handles thousands of particles without breaking a sweat. Marcus suggested we move the rendering layer to **WebGL** for better performance.

Also spent time on [[honeycomber]] v1.5 release notes. **Sarah** reviewed the PR and caught a subtle race condition in the event bus. Good catch.

## Tools
Deep into **Claude Code** today for pair programming on the tide-pool physics. Set up `tmux` with a four-pane layout — editor, build watcher, test runner, and git log. **Vite** hot reload is instant which makes the iteration cycle blazing fast.

Tried out **Codex** for generating boilerplate test fixtures but the results needed heavy editing. #productivity

## Decisions
Chose **WebGL** over Canvas2D for the tide-pool renderer because of the particle count requirements. This led to pulling in `Three.js` as the rendering foundation rather than raw WebGL calls.

## Lessons
**Always benchmark before choosing a renderer** — our Canvas2D prototype looked fine at 100 particles but choked at 2000. The WebGL version handles 10k without dropping frames.
