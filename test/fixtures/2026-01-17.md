## Projects
Transitioning focus from [[tide-pool]] to [[nacre]] this week. The tide-pool Phase 2 is essentially complete — just bug fixes and polish remaining. marcus is handling the remaining edge cases.

Started designing the nacre ingestion pipeline. The core idea: a **sleep/wake consolidation model** where the parser runs during "sleep" (heartbeats/cron), never in real-time. This mirrors how the brain does **memory consolidation** during actual sleep — hippocampal replay strengthens connections that formed during waking hours.

Quick check on [[siphon]] — **Pat** finished the data extraction module. It parses API responses into normalized schemas. Clean work.

## Architecture
The [[nacre]] data model needs these entity types: person, project, tool, concept, decision, event, lesson. Each entity is a node in the graph with temporal metadata — when first seen, when last reinforced, how many times mentioned.

Edges connect entities through four relationship types: explicit (wikilinks), co-occurrence (same section), temporal (same day), and causal ("led to", "because of"). #architecture

## Tools
Set up the nacre monorepo with npm workspaces. Three packages: `@nacre/core`, `@nacre/parser`, `@nacre/cli`. Using `tsup` for building each package. **TypeScript** strict mode from day one.

## Lessons
**Start with types** — defining the data model before writing any logic forces you to think through the domain. The types became the spec.
