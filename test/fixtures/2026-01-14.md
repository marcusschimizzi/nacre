## Projects
Continued [[tide-pool]] Phase 2 with **Marcus**. Focused on the fluid dynamics simulation today — the `bitECS` queries are performing well but we need to optimize the spatial partitioning. Marcus S suggested looking at quadtree implementations for neighbor detection.

Quick sync on [[strata]] with **James**. He is building the layer management system and ran into TypeScript generic constraints issues. Helped him work through it. The project is progressing steadily toward the alpha milestone.

## Tools
**TypeScript** strict mode is saving us from so many bugs. The type inference on the ECS component definitions is particularly elegant. Using **Docker** containers for the CI pipeline — each package gets its own build stage.

Set up **Playwright** for browser testing the tide-pool visualization. First test suite runs headless across Chrome and Firefox. #testing

## Research
Read about **force-directed graphs** for a potential visualization project. The physics simulation approach feels natural for representing relationships — things that belong together attract each other. Reminded me of how **spatial memory** works in the brain.

## Lessons
**Docker layer caching is critical** for CI performance — our builds went from 8 minutes to 90 seconds by properly ordering the Dockerfile layers. This resulted in much faster feedback cycles for the team.
