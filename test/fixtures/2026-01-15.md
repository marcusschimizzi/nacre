## Projects
Big day on [[tide-pool]]. **Marcus** and I got the WebGL renderer fully integrated with the ECS. Particles now flow beautifully with realistic fluid dynamics. The [[Vite]] build system handles the shader imports seamlessly.

Discussed **nacre** concept with Marcus — the idea of turning memory files into a spatial graph. He is excited about the visualization possibilities with [[3d-force-graph]]. We sketched out the basic architecture on a whiteboard.

Also checked in on [[clawdbot]] — the heartbeat system is stable and **Lobstar** reported good session priming results.

## Tools
**Claude Code** was invaluable for debugging a WebGL shader compilation issue. The error messages from WebGL are notoriously unhelpful but claude figured out the uniform binding order was wrong.

Using `tmux` sessions extensively now — muscle memory is building for the pane switching shortcuts. #productivity

## Decisions
Decided to use **ESM** throughout the tide-pool monorepo. This led to cleaner import paths and better tree-shaking. Had to update all the `tsup` configs but it was worth it because of the improved module resolution.

## Events
**First successful WebGL render** of the full tide-pool simulation — 5000 particles flowing in real-time at 60fps. Marcus called it "mesmerizing." Major milestone.

## Lessons
**Shader debugging requires systematic isolation** — comment everything out, add one feature back at a time. Random changes to shader code will waste hours.
