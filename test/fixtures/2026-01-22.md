## Projects
Implemented the [[nacre]] **decay model** today. The **Ebbinghaus** forgetting curve is elegant — just a few lines of math but the behavior is profound. An unreinforced connection halves in ~46 days. One that has been reinforced 7 times takes ~189 days to halve.

**Marcus** tested the decay functions with edge cases — zero days, very large time gaps, negative dates. Found a bug where daysBetween was not taking absolute values. Fixed.

Checked on [[anemone]] — **Dr. Chen** is leading the data visualization component library. She wants to use **D3.js** for the low-level primitives and compose them into higher-level chart components.

## Implementation
The stability formula `S = 1 + β · ln(R + 1)` means:
- First mention: stability = 1.0 (decays at base rate)
- After 1 reinforcement: stability ≈ 2.0 (decays at half the base rate)
- After 7 reinforcements: stability ≈ 4.1 (very slow decay)

This feels right — things you encounter once fade quickly. Things you keep coming back to persist. Exactly how human memory works.

Applied decay to all edges after each consolidation cycle. Edges below the visibility threshold (0.05) become dormant but are not deleted — they can be revived if reinforced again. #research

## Tools
**Node.js** test runner is great for unit tests. Used `node:test` describe/it blocks with `node:assert/strict`. Zero dependencies for testing. The decay math tests verify against the expected half-life table from the architecture doc.

## Lessons
**Test edge cases with math functions** — floating point arithmetic is treacherous. Use epsilon comparisons instead of strict equality. Because of this, all our decay tests use a tolerance of ±0.05.
